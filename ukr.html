<p>Russian forces have struck several cities in western Ukraine since March 11. The barrage marked an escalation of Moscowâ€™s offensive and moved the fighting perilously close to the Polish border. More than 30 Russian cruise missiles hit the International Peacekeeping and Security Center (IPSC) facility in Yavoriv, which has long been used to train Ukrainian soldiers, often with instructors from the United States and other countries in the Western alliance

    NATO said Sunday that it currently does not have any personnel in Ukraine, though the United States has increased the number of U.S. troops deployed to Poland, according to the Associated Press.
